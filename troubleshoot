Q: EX-7 wont inject!
A: Make sure you have the x86 version of the Visual C++ Redistributable

and also make sure your pc's anti virus is excluding EX-7.exe and EX-7.dll

Q: When I try to execute a script, I get a messagebox saying OP_something, what does this mean?

EX-7 will only output this error if you're running a script that EX-7 cannot support. Ask the community
